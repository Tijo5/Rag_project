# # Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can retrieve and generate answers based on information from a specific document. The system is containerized using Docker, making it easy to set up and run on any machine.

## Features
- **Retrieve** information from large documents based on user queries.
- **Generate** contextually accurate responses using a free language model.
- Fully containerized for easy deployment with Docker.
- Designed to work with any text-based document.

## Requirements
- **Docker** (tested with Docker version 27.4.0 or later).
- Optional: **Python 3.9 or later** (for running locally without Docker).
